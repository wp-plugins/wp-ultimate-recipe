3. Recipes are added as a custom post type to your WordPress backend and can be handled just like normal posts. Your recipes can be categorized and tagged however you want it.

6. The shortcode editor is easy to use and will automatically generate the correct shortcode for the recipe you want.

8. Recipe ingredients (and cuisines, courses, ...) are custom taxonomies and can therefore be used in lots of different widgets, like the Tag Cloud widget you see here.
9. Clicking on the Print Button will allow your visitors to print the recipe in a paper-friendly format without any layout or photos.
10. WP Ultimate Recipe automatically formats your data so it can be picked up by Google Recipe Search and others. Great for SEO!
